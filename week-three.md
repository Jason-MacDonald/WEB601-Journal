# Week Three

### Introductions
The focus up until now has been introducing us to a variety of technologies used in web development. We have looked at front end coding including HTMS, CSS and I have now started working through the codecademy javascript introduction. Many off the tutorial covered so far in code academy I have crossed at one time or another but they have been great refreshers and there are definately a few additions that I haven't seen before. CSS Grid was an example I've mentioned previously, and the javascript course has chucked in some new (to me) stuff right from the get go. ES6 has been around for a while now but this is one of the first times I've come across ternary operators, string literals and a few other items. These appear like nice shorthand code to tidy up space so I'm looking forward to see what else is available.

### Group Project
Although we didn't get very far with our group project deliverable, collaberating and working with git was a lot of fun. Don't get me wrong, We definately had our share of issues, but fixing things is part of the fun, and we will only get better with practice.

### Codecademy
Codecademy is great fun. It's probably one of the more enjoyable learning to code experiences I've come accross. I've currently finished the HTML and CSS introduction and have begun work on the javascript introduction. I've also chucked a few others in my TODO: pile such as the reactjs and git courses.

### Node.js
We started looking at nodejs which appears to be some kind of package manager where applications can be easily imported into a project. I'm looking forward to see what it can do.

### Operators +-#/%
For the first half of the second session we looked at a variety of operators and jumped into boolean logic. I have a general understanding of boolean logic, although today was the first time I have come across the Implication logic where A implies B. It does seem like there might easier ways to code the logic for an implication.  

### Global and Local Memory
The discussion we had around how the global and local memory work was very interesting. Understanding what's happening under the hood might not be required to 'make things work', it can let us better understand what our code is actually doing and may come in handy when we are trying to debug or improve performance. 

### Homework
We got our first alot of course specified homework this week. I have created the WEB601-Homework repository to complete homework tasks. This weeks was pretty simple and required us to create a couple of functions that performed some simple arithmatic. I managed to refactor the answers into single line functions. Initially I was concerned it might make it confusing using the ECS arrow syntax because I hadn't really used it before, But after a little practice it is MUCH easier to read! 

### Project
I have been wireframing up an idea for the projects website using inVision. It's a pretty basic online tool where you pretty much draw the wireframe and it tidies it up a bit. It also has collaberation options where different users can use different collars on the same project. It's a very basic little tool but has everything it needs to mock up a quick design.

I then replicated the wireframe using another tool called Marvel. This tool was a little more comprehensive and had a variety of additional tools to use.
