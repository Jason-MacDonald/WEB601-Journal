# Week Three

### Introductions
The focus up until now has been introducing us to a variety of technologies used in web development. We have looked at front end coding including HTMS, CSS and I have now started working through the codecademy javascript introduction. Many off the tutorial covered so far in code academy I have crossed at one time or another but they have been great refreshers and there are definately a few additions that I haven't seen before. CSS Grid was an example I've mentioned previously, and the javascript course has chucked in some new (to me) stuff right from the get go. ES6 has been around for a while now but this is one of the first times I've come across ternary operators, string literals and a few other items. These appear like nice shorthand code to tidy up space so I'm looking forward to see what else is available.

### Group Project
Although we didn't get very far with our group project deliverable, collaberating and working with git was a lot of fun. Don't get me wrong, We definately had our share of issues, but fixing things is part of the fun, and we will only get better with practice.

### Codecademy
Codecademy is great fun. It's probably one of the more enjoyable learning to code experiences I've come accross. I've currently finished the HTML and CSS introduction and have begun work on the javascript introduction. I've also chucked a few others in my TODO: pile such as the reactjs and git courses.

### Node.js
We started looking at nodejs which appears to be some kind of package manager where applications can be easily imported into a project. I'm looking forward to see what it can do.

### Operators

### Functions

### Global and Local Memory

### Homework

### Project
I have been wireframing up an idea for the projects website using inVision. It's a pretty basic online tool where you pretty much draw the wireframe and it tidies it up a bit. It also has collaberation options where different users can use different collars on the same project. It's a very basic little tool but has everything it needs to mock up a quick design.
