# WEB601 Journal: Week Six

### Teacher Only Week
With no official classes this week I have mainly continued on with a variety of tutorials. We did have a class on Friday where we found more tutorials on FreeCodeCamp. This had a range of tutorials and I started straight on the javascript algorythm section. This is great because these are the types of puzzles that makes me enjoying codeing. It's interesting to see first how I might implement it without searching around and then finding some of the more simple or sophisticated was to produce the same result

### Project
The end of last week was a mad rush to get milestone one complete by monday. After submitting milestone one. I'm pretty happy with the current result however I'm looking forward to seeing what techniques we can use to make it look a bit better. 

### Meet Up
We also created/joined a MeetUp group for HTML and CSS group which will be interesting, although the first meetup isn't until the mid semester break. I will have to have a look at some of the other tech related networking opportunities available in the area.
