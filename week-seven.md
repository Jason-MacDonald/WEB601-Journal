# WEB601 Journal: Week Seven

### Web Development Stacks lightening talks
We were introduced today to a lightening talk we will be required to present in just over a weeks time which is based around development stacks. I kind of get the idea of a stack which is really just a list of the specific technologies used for a project but know little about most of the technologies themselves. Putting the presentation together will hopefully be able to fill a bit of those knowledge holes, at least in a general overview of those technologies kind of way.
Presentations should include:
* Information about the technologies used,
* Information on use of the technology; github users, forks, upkeep information etc.
* A small demo. :S 

### Components: Class vs Function
Most of the class was based around components. We discussed the difference between state-full and stateless components. 
* class = state-full
* function = stateless

For my initial run through of the project I used state-full or class component structure for all components. Since then I have had a look through the project and selected out several components which I figured would be better suited to be functional components as they didn't really need to keep the state of itself. The were simply called and displayed.
These were pretty simple to change as the bulk of the component code remained the same.

### Babel
We also discussed a little bit about Babel which translates different javascript versions to a single base version to make sure the application is compatible with most browsers.

### Free Code Camp
Tutorials tutorials tutorial... luckily I quite like tutorials and generally pop one open to do rather than watch television but I'm also very wary that if I try to pump too much in at one time my level of retention can diminish pretty quick. I've started working through code camp when there's a bit of spare time but it's not really something that plentifully flows at this time of the semester. We'll see how we go.

### Spell Checking
Somewhat out of the scope of the course but I had a bit of an issue with my very poor spelling throughout my journal. I was reading over some of my older entries and they was a tad concerned about how many spelling mistakes I'd made. I did manage to find a simple extension so hopefully my entries will be slightly more readable from here on in.
