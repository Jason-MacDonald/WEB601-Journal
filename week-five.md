# WEB601 Journal: Week Five

### Revision and Project Defining
The first session for week five we spent alot of time complaining about struggling to fit everything in to the provided timeframe... I feel like I'm reasonably up to date but not sitting slightly ahead where I normally like to be with the project.

### URL
We then moved on to disecting a URL. I was perhaps a little behind the eight ball as I hadn't finished the javascript codeacademy course which just so happens to contain alot of information around the URL but I new most of the easy stuff like the what part was the protocol, host, subdomain etc, however I haven't really covered the query string side of things in much detail before. Now that I'm back doing the codecademy it's all fitting in to place.

### Codecademy
Still trying to catch up to the bus in terms of codecademy this week. Have completed HTML and CSS courses and have almost completed the javascript introduction. The js intro is far bigger than the other two but I am currently working on the last section which is about HTTP requests and really quite important for our project... I've also completed half of the express course and half of the first React course.

### Project
I've created a few 'project' repositories at this point, trying to follow along in tutorials to get a base for my project. For some reason after the first few steps, everyone does things a little bit differently. I do have something working now where I have created a variety of React components which I can then render in the browser. The tutorial I followed walked through a navigation using routes which was great but I'm still a little unsure of how to manipulate them to work how I want. My report for milestone one is fully drafted, I just need to run over it before Friday (Hand in date) and tidy it up a bit.

### React App
For the second class of the week we created a React-App from the ground up. We looked at adding the Faker package which will be usefull to add temporary data during prototyping. I had managed to create a few of these out of class including an Express app but it doesn't appear that we are using express for the first stage of the project.

### Routers
I was hoping to cover routes during the extended session but we didn't end up with enough time. I was a little confused about where we should be with the routes for milestone one as I was a little mixed up with what we had learned for express. After looking at the provided example I had actually allready implemented routes enough to cover the requirements of milestone one.

### Project Continued
I managed to create most of the components for the website before the deadline. The project currently has most of the components and prototype content that will be required. I have attempted a little bit of styling just to generate a slightly more appealing canvas to work on, however I am interested to see how to "pretty-fy" using react as I believe this is the ultimate intention.
