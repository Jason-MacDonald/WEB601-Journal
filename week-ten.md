# WEB601 Journal: Week Ten

### MySQL
For the first session this week we started working with a test database which included tables for Employees and Departments. After looking at MySQL briefly last week, all that DAT602 knowledge came flooding back and this was a pretty simple task, although it can be one of those simple but time consuming tasks trying to put together enough records for testing.

After getting the bare minimum done :D I was able to start generating the Data Definition Language required for the simple database I had planned for Milestone Two of the project. I didn't quite get to adding the test data during class as we moved on with the next adventure but should have it up and running soon.

### Knex <-> MySQL
We also had a look at Knex and MySQL, and more specifically how to communicate between them. We were given an example which allowed us to perform calls such as GET, POST, UPDATE, and DELETE from the Employee table and then created similar calls for the departments table. It was a little confusing at first but after getting one or two done it became a bit easier.
I had a little time left after the exercise so I even managed to create a GET request in my own project before leaving class.

### Class Project Work
I managed to get the a variety of calls completed between the first and second class of the week. These were able to function using Insomnia as I was having a few issues with the original Postman app we were using for testing our requests. I'm a little confused about how a search request would work but will look into achieving this over the holidays.
