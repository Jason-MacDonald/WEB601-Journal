# WEB602 Journal: Week One

Week one of WEB602 involved investigating and practicing source code management using GitHub services.

I signed up for a GitHub account a while ago not really knowing what it was. With only a few hours spent figuring it out and practicing commands, I'm not sure how I've lived without it.

Git itself is an open source version control system. This system allows development to be maintained in a central repository with shared access. Teams of people can collaborate, copies can be downloaded or cloned to a local system, code can be altered, and the results merged and pushed back to the central repository.

Outside of class, we have continued the online git tutorial available at [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org).

The first section of the tutorial is based around local management, and understanding the commands to commit, branch, merge, rebase, and also how to navigate using direct selections and relative references. The commands themselves are relatively simple and easy to follow.

The second section is a little more advanced and focuses on remote management. The commands themselves are not overly difficult, however the actual effects of the commands can be a little confusing. Further practice both in the learngitbranching sandbox and managment of this blog should help to fill any knowledge gaps. I will also set up a testing repository so I can test commands without fear of breaking everything.
