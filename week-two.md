# Week Two
We've had quite a bit of stuff to move on with in week two:

### Code Academy
We started several courses on [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). The HTML class walked through many of the HTML basics from header and paragraph elements, to forms, inputs and the box model. This was a good refresher from previous learning and included a few new things I hadn't used before such as the input button type (rather than the button element). Code

We also started a CSS course which is running through alot of the basic CSS properties. Codecademy is pretty fun and simple to use, I'm looking forward to jump into the javascript later this week as I have limited experience with it. 

### Git 
We have been training on GIT to manage our source code. I feel I have the basics down such as forking, merging and pushing back to the remote repo, though We have been running into a few issues now that we are collaborating on a small group project. The training at [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org) has been valuable although I'm not fully comprehending some of the more advanced features.

### Design
We looked at several different design aspects which we will using for our project. This included storyboards, prototyping and wireframing etc. These are all aspects of the conceptual design which was covered comprehensively during the level 5 DESign course. We will working on wireframinf for our projects in the coming week.

### Project
I have been searching for a business in the area I can use for the project. The [Car Company](https://www.carcompanynelson.co.nz) website is looking a little dated so I'm thinking I will tackle it for my project.

I'm currently working up some paper prototypes and looking at some of the free  wireframing tools. Unfortunately design is not one of my strong points and I'm aiming towards being a code monkey but we'll see how this goes...
