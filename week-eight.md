# WEB601 Journal: Week Eight

### Class Practical
First up for this week we are taking a look at the basics of a web application by looking at it in a very minimal way and creating simple components with limited fluff. The practical was making since for the first 80% to 90% of the time but then I ran n to issues when it was time to translate the ES6 code using Babel. For some reason or another it didn't want to  work and the error I wa getting was not very helpful at pointing me in the right direction. I tried modifying a few things and playing around with a few others but couldn't get it to work. 

After trying again from scratch at home and having it do the exact same thing I ended up having a look around for some similar tutorials. None of them were quite the same but but I eventually found one that was very similar to what we had covered.

### Presentation
Out of class I have done a bit of research on KNEX, which is a backend framework and essentially allows us to make connections and communicate with SQL based databases. I did pick this one because we found out it was going to be used in the project and I figured it would be a nice little head start before we looked at it i class. One thing I don't really understand ( although I'm sure it will become apparent) is that KNEX seems to be primarily used to build SQL queries, but from my understanding this can be done using strings anyway. It will be interesting to see how / if a string builder makes this easier.

### Contributing In Git
For Friday's class we met in Kowhai lounge for our presentations to have a look at contributing to Git repositories. I kinda wish this was the environment we normally studied in to be honest... I started off by following a repository which had been specifically designed for people to make their first contribution. This was a relatively simple and was a great way to jump in. I then went off to find a repository where I felt like I could help format or update their README.md. I did find one and started formatting and changing some of their wording (English was the persons second language and although it was readable and understandable there were a few things that were around the wrong way or slightly odd). Unfortunately I wasn't able to finish before presentations and most of my out of class time is being spent on NET. 

### Post Presentation
The presentations went pretty well. It was interesting to hear about what everyone had been researching. Unfortunately as I have an irrational yet crippling fear of public speaking, I was getting more and more anxious as the presentations went on.

### Tutorials
I've done a few sections of the javascript tutorial this week but my time has unfortunately been funneled into the NET project which is due very soon and is throwing some major wobblies.
