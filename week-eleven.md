# WEB601 Journal: Week Eleven

### Peer Coding
For todays session we did some peer coding. Luckily I had Callum whom I had been peer coding with the day before and we were able to finish what we didn't quite get done the day before. We had connected his database and created his routes but didn't quite get on to creating and testing any actual requests. We put together a couple of get requests and tested them in insomnia which surprisingly didn't take much trouble shooting. 

After that I worked on my own project to implement a delete request called by a form. This was also surprisingly simple which is making me finally feel like I'm getting some of the main concepts of web requests. The difficulty I am having now is dealing with the data once it's been retrieved. As I mentioned in last weeks blog I'm doing this in a couple of different ways. For one I am passing things from component to component to component which works, and I understand, but I'm pretty sure it's not an efficient way to do it. The other deals with it in one place and uses far less code but tends to be a repeat of what I had set up earlier. There's also a couple pieces of code that I don't fully understand.

Overall though, I am pretty happy with my progress. I've spent a fair amount of time trying to help other people that are struggling with a couple of things which has had good results and has allowed me to look at things over and over agin to really dig it in, but there's still a long way to go before I would have something that was even close to being commercially viable. :(

### Project
Mainly tidying things up at the moment and trying to add comments for hand in. I have been wondering if there's an extension that will display/remove comments while working on a project. I know that comments are important but they actually make what I'm looking at less readable. Perhaps I just need to get more use to it :S
