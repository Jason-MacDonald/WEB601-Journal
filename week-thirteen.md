# WEB601 Journal: Week Thirteen

### Flux
For this week we looked at Flux, an architectural pattern created by Facebook. Flux was created to overcome application state management which the MVC (Model View COntroller) finds difficult. Flux is used to maintain a single source of the application state.

The flow of flux is: 
* View calls an action,
* The action calls a dispatch,
* The action is dispatched to the store, and
* The store notifies the view.

### Tutorials
I have started / completed several tutorials based around react and redux and have started to integrate it in to my project. I get the general concepts but am having difficulty piecing it all together and regularly have to research the syntax for what I'm trying to achieve. Hopefully a bit more practice and I'll be well on the way to a react-redux front-end application.

### Peer Coding
I do a lot of peer coding with one of my class mates. This has been really beneficial because it identifies which things I understand enough to try and explain to someone else, and which things I steer at blankly trying to work out an explanation for it being there. Unfortunately the latter is happening far more often than I had hoped...

### Interview
We had the interview this week to demo our projects. There wasn't really anything pointed out that I already figured would need some additional work. Unfortunately I'm not sure how far I will get with the items I need to work on as I feel I could muddle through them and get them done, but really want to focus on state management. I feel once I get a good grasp on it, it will be much easier to create the functionality that the application is currently missing.
