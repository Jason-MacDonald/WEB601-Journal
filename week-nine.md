# WEB601 Journal: Week Nine

### MySQL
We started the week having a look at MySQL. It was kinda scary when I opened it up and thought 'What the hell am I looking at' even though I was pretty comfortable with it last semester. After writing a few lines of code it all came flooding back though. Luckily I should be able to do the MySQL related stuff without too much trouble, but the communication using request and Knex is completely new to me so we will see how it goes. 

### Class Practical
We started an ongoing practical for this week. It was a 'start from scratch' project where we first initiated a project and generated the ability to begin listening on a specified port. This part of the practical was reasonably straight forward and didn't have too many issues. Most people were able to get it working pretty quickly and I ran through it again the following day with a class mate which has probably helped further familiarize myself with the process. I'm generally try to get things working and then lend a hand if I can as I've found one of the best ways to retain information i to actually walk someone through the process.

For the second session, the plan was to look at the communication between the client and the database. This involved looking at the different ways to create http requests and testing them out using postman. I feel like I was able to follow about 70% of the class but I did find it difficult iterating through the different ways to do it and walking away from class I'm not really sure how everything connects together but I feel I was able to follow along and at the very least read the code and gain a general understanding. I usually prefer to learn a single way to do something, get some practice and completely understand what's happening, and THEN look at the different ways that it can be accomplished so that I have something to compare it to. I'm hopefully going to have a study session later on today to run over the concept and try to develop a better understanding.

### FreeCodeCamp
I worked through a few of the topics in the javascript algorithm section but was feeling like there were some basic things that I didn't know about like the filter method and a few others. I ended up going back and completing the basic section which started off relatively easy and then got a bit harder near the end. I managed to do most of them without having to go to the MDN documentation or use a hint although there was a a couple that had me stumped. They ended up being mainly syntax errors but there was one that I got completely stuck on and still don't really understand it so I will have to go back and have another look at it at some stage. I've also started the ES6 section which has all been new to me this semester but is quite interesting in terms of how much smaller some of the code can be, and how much easier it can be to read.

### Up Next
The next few things I will be working on are routes, which I need to have a bit more of a play with and organizing a database schema for the project. It's been a while since I've worked on the project files so hopefully it will still make sense when I open it back up.
