# WEB601 Journal: Week Fourteen

### Real World Example
We discussed a real world example of redux involving an insurance company and compared it with how redux should work in our application. It was interesting to see the flow of events in a real world scenario (Real world as in, people passing around forms). This has helped me think about the flow of events that will take place in my application.

### Login and Registration
We looked at to templates which were very clean examples of how the login and registration can work in redux. One of the examples used a a token system which I would like to implement in my project but as we are nearing the end of the course I have been more focused on figuring out redux before I start moving on with tokenized functionality. Unfortunately I haven't been able to get much of the cosmetic work done that I had hoped to before the next interview. I'm hoping my project will pass on the merits of it's functionality :S

### Tutorial
I completed the tutorial found at https://www.valentinog.com/blog/redux/ which was really helpful and used very simple descriptions. It also started from scratch and allowed me to see how the project might come about from the very beginning rather than the iterative approach that our project has taken. I'm going to run through it again at some point so I will hopefully have the ability to whip up a suitable react-redux environment pretty quickly.
